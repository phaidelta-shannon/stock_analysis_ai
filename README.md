# Analyzing Stocks via AI Agent

### Problem Statement: API-Driven AI Stock Analysis Agent

Develop a FastAPI-based backend that serves as an autonomous AI agent for stock analysis. The agent will retrieve historical stock data using yFinance, then leverage the OpenAI API to analyze the data and generate insightsâ€”such as trend analyses, anomaly detections, and predictive summaries. These insights will be exposed through dedicated API endpoints, enabling seamless integration and programmatic access to the AI-generated stock analysis. Drop the UI for now
